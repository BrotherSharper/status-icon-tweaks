# Status Icon Tweaks

 This module allows GM users to shift status effect icons off tokens, allowing the full token art to be visible even when multiple status effect icons are present.

 Icons can also be scaled to either a selected grid size (e.g. 3x3 icons) or by inputting a specific icon scale.
 Non-modded scaling behaviour can be be reproduced by setting the Custom Grid Size setting to "Custom Scale" and setting the Custom Icon Scale to 1.
